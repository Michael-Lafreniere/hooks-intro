# Hooks Intro

A simple little demonstration project using React and the NASA open API.  It demostrates basic and simple usage of React Hooks for a blog post I'm writing.  If you're just going to run the site a few times, the demo key from NASA is sufficent but I believe you only get 15 queries from their database an hour with it.  Signing up for an actual key allowing hundreds or more queries an hour is easy and free.  You can then, in App.js replace apiKey with your key.  Other than the picture of the day, all other images are static.
